Final Blockchain Night of Winter semester is coming up soon!

ICOs ever overcome the currently shady public image? Will they leave venture  funds out of business and open a new era of crowdfunding? Our speakers have first-hand ICO expertise and will offer their unique views on this controversial subject.

 - Dr Philipp Hacker from HU Law School will start the discussion exploring the current legal framework of EU
 - followed by Ingmar Wegel,  vice president at Clipperton (international M&A advisors) who will share the current industry experience on raising funds through ICOs and why it might not be a good idea
 - concluded by Balazs Deme, CEO at Herdius - first startup to boldly launch an ICO in Germany

Wether or not you are planning to participate or launch an ICO in the nearest future, we invite you to register at www.blockchainnights.com and join the discussion.

We have around 17 places left so please be quick, as we are making this one a limited attendance BCN to ensure a comfortable environment for discussion.
